"A very useful and unique app with a simple UI similar to messaging apps. Just fix these issues to make it even better: 1- in English you write from left to right on the page, but in some other languages like Persian it's opposite and Because of that sentences look out of place and hard to work with if it's not in English and this problem wasn't present in older versions. 2- Make the Date/Time option To not change text order and just add it after the last sentence in bottom right.",4,0,Request for Enhancements

If someone tried to open my notes they can see the titles and some of the contents of the notes. 3. We need to be able to color code the notes and control the colors of note groups.

"This app was great until the latest update. Now it can't open but luckily I backed up my notes to drive before updating it. The problem is only the voice notes can play, as for the written ones they can only be opened in the app no other app can open them and I need to acces them as soon as I can they are very important. Please fix this problem ASAP because some of us really had important notes otherwise the app is very good.",4,4,App Crashes
"My apologies! It does work. I was expecting/hoping to be able to see my notes in the file manager's text viewer, but at least I can see them in the Notes to Self app. Had some difficulty because the first couple of times, I either couldn't select or couldn't see the backup file when trying to open it - maybe that's some kind of intermittent bug? But I have now installed on a different phone and successfully used Restore, and my notes look exactly as I left them. Good, I want to like this app üôÇ",4,4,Backup and Recovery Improvements
"EDIT: the next update that came out about a day later fixed it for me; the app opens now and my notes are there. Phew. Upping to 4 stars because it was fixed so quickly, and I'll start creating backups now that I know of the issue. ORIGINAL: I loved this note app, until the update today. I'm now unable to open the app and I just noticed the description on the app page now says ""Please create backups regularly, you can lose your notes during app updates."" Nice... Welp. Bye bye notes...",4,4,Backup and Recovery Improvements
So far this is the easiest one. Little more expensive than others. But some more options but not too many. I already have a calendar or use I don't need that in a notepad. Anyway some of them won't even let you change the font size. That's crazy for a no pen. Anyway this one was easy the one that came with my phone I hated. And I own it for life for 699 can't beat it. We'll see this is only my first day. Thanks,5,4,Initial Impressions

"Very useful! I like how you can edit ""sent"" messages, bc you can't do that if you use whatsapp/chatting apps for notes. However, I think it should have a ""re-order"" option. Where you can select certain messages in a chat, and reorder them to your convenience (move them up/down). This would be useful for people who want to use this app as their main notes/to-do list app. We reorganize things frequently as things, plans and priorities change. But in my experience to do that in this app is tedious",5,5,Request for Enhancements
"Loved it. Until one day, the app refused to open and I don't know why. Lost all my saved items. Forced myself to use a different app from now on.

"Overall a really good app for taking notes quickly!

"Well the app is great. But the backup system is bugged. My notes got partially deleted. I think this needs the devs attention. Also, when you're typing a note and you accidentally press the back button, everything you've written down will be gone. A workaround could be, saving the message as draft when you accidentally press the back button. Like other messaging app does.",2,5,Backup and Recovery Improvements
"UPDATE: It now functions without an internet connection, and is usable again. Thanks to the developers for a great app :) Old review: I have been using this app for a while, and it has been excellent, but today I discovered (fortunately I had a fallback eSim) that I cannot open it without an internet connection. This is absurd. I cannot use this app if I can't rely on it to give me access to my notes when I need them.",5,6,App Crashes

"I'm really excited to see that someone else already had the same thought as me & brought this app to life. It's incredibly useful to have a memo app with an interface designed like a messaging app. You can create different threads for every topic then give it a title and a topic photo. You can type memos, leave voice memos, add pictures, edit the memos you already wrote, and lock the app using biometrics. Clean UI. Dark mode. Now would you just download it already?üì≤üëçüèª",5,6,Positive User Experience
"Feature Request :- Optional sound effect on pressing the send button just like whatsapp, the ability to rearrange note titles (for eg putting ""to read/watch"" above ""daily journal"") and some more themes and colours to make it look just like a chatting app. Otherwise a straight up 5 star app just as Sam Beckman said.

"This was all good, even if it's minimalist it isn't for me, I'm unsatisfied but I'll just enjoyed the features and app (I says to myself) Not until last April, it keeps stopping I'm no fun anymore, my 2k plus notes are at stake. One thing more, I read all the terms and policies including backing up,but that's no use, the back up and restore seems have problem too.",1,6,Backup and Recovery Improvements
"This is such an incredible idea! For people like me who want to keep a private journal but don't know how to write one, this is definitely a lifesaver. I'm able to express myself freely as if I'm having a conversation, which in my opinion is way more effective at conveying emotions than through regular means of writing. There are a few places where the app could be improved, such as adding bold and italic text or custom fonts, but as of right now, it gets five stars from me",5,7,Therapeutic Note-Taking
"The app overall is great for simple note taking by using a messaging format by grouping them by chats which is really intuitive. Small changes I'd like to suggest but not necessarily needed, more options like the color scheme and font sizes since the sizes are pretty small for me to see without my glasses and color for more options but not necessary :>",5,7,Unique Note Organization
I love everything about this app except that it doesn't work without wifi which is really confusing to me and takes me to the Play Store instead. Hope this can get fixed since I would want to access my notes offline and this app feels like it's literally meant to be simple enough to work offline.,4,7,Ease of Use
"Great, simple to use. It's very good for its purpose so I got Pro. There are a few things I would like added: Being able to put notes in an ""Archived"" so you don't have to delete them and way easier to access. Selecting multiple notes at once to delete. Having a space between a short period of time and a time seperator subheading (e.g ùüØ:ùüØùü¨ ùóîùó† / ùü±:ùü¨ùüÆ ùóîùó†) for longer periods.

With this app you can organize each text with a title and add ideas throughout the day or whenever and it logs the date and time of each App Request * I love this app - I wanted to ask if you could make it where there are groups.

"Simply amazing. Edit- One problem here. Why is it directing me to play store when I open it without internet connection? It is bothersome and happening after I updated it, which I did today.

I loved this app until I tried using it after Android 14 update. Now the fingerprint reader pops up but doesn't register the finger (it doesn't light up or respond with the haptic). The pin doesn't worth either. What's odd is that the app appears to open only to crash. Just won't open at all. I have lots of notes in the app and I will be upset if i can't access them.

This used to be a good app. Now as far as I think the developer has updated the app and all the older versions would not launch and crash immediately. That forced me to uninstall which I don't mind but I lost a lot of data which was very important to me. Now after installing it again I don't have the data using which I can restore.
